                <h2>Study on Alignment</h2><br>
                <h3>Example: <a href="https://www.nike.com/" alt="link to nike.com">Nike</a></h3><br>
                <img src="images/image4.png" alt='This is a screenshot of Nikes website.'>
                <p>This website gives an excellent example of the principle of alignment. As you look at the photo above, you will see that the images are all on the same left alignment. Also, aligned with the images is the subject headers. Within the images themselves, the link to shop and all the text is aligned.</p>

        <section id="row2">
                <p>Microsofts homepage uses white space and padding masterfully. If you look that the icons at the top, they are all given adequate space between to clearly view each one. Also, you will see that microsoft uses a lot of white space in the grey box that contains the "This is your 365" heading. The text is clear and doesn't feel cramped and there is appropriate amount of pace between the text, the buttons, and within the buttons.</p>
                <img src="images/spacing_example.jpg" alt="Snapshot of Microsofts homepage">
                <h2>Use Of White Space</h2><br>
                <h3>Example: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/" alt='Link to microsofts hom page'>Microsoft</a></h3><br>
        </section>

        <section id="row3">
                <h2>Harnessing Contrast</h2>
                <br>
                <h3>Example: <a href='https://glitch.com/' alt='Glitch homepage'>Glitch</a></h3>
                <br>
                <img src="images/contrast.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Glitch.com">
                <br>
                <p>When it comes to providing contrast, Glitch does a fantastic job. Glitch starts out with creating a white background and then it throws bold colors all over it. The colors themselves provide a great contrast going from cool colors to warm and back. They also play with the alignment to provide contrast to certain statements. You can see they have a company tag line that is slightly askew and draws the eye.</p>
